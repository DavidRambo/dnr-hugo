I am currently completing a BS in Computer Science at Oregon State University as part of a career change from academia in the humanities.
My interests include systems programming, databases, and distributed computing.

Previously, I worked as a postdoctoral associate in media theory at Duke University with the Graduate Program in Literature.
My research and teaching spanned contemporary fiction and media, the technological nature of human experience, process philosophy, and phenomenology.
My essays have been published in <i>Computational Culture</i>, <i>Process Studies</i>, <i>Angelaki</i>, and <i>Post-Cinema: Theorizing 21st-Century Film</i> (REFRAME 2016).

<p>I also enjoy tinkering and making things. While at Duke, I collaborated with the humanities lab <a href="https://s-1lab.org" alt="S-1: Speculative Sensation" target="_blank">S-1: Speculative Sensation</a>. You can see my QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) code on GitHub for a few ortholinear keyboards: Boardsource's <a href="https://github.com/DavidRambo/qmk_firmware/tree/lulu_keymap/keyboards/boardsource/lulu/keymaps/davidrambo" target="_blank" alt="Lulu QMK" target="_blank">Lulu</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/DavidRambo/qmk_firmware/tree/personal/keyboards/crkbd/keymaps/davidrambo" target="_blank" alt="Corne QMK" target="_blank">Corne</a>, OLKB's <a href="https://github.com/DavidRambo/qmk_firmware/tree/lulu_keymap/keyboards/preonic/keymaps/davidrambo" target="_blank" alt="Preonic QMK">Preonic</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/DavidRambo/qmk_firmware/tree/personal/keyboards/xiudi/xd75/keymaps/davidrambo" target="_blank" alt="XD75 QMK">XD75</a>.</p>
