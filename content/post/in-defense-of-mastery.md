Mastery, as a concept and as a practical relation to one's world, has been devalued.
This devaluation is a result of a narrow focus on mastery as a social relation, which understands mastery as a domination or subordination by one or a group of person(s) over other(s).
When mastery comes up in other, albeit sometimes related, contexts such as knowledge and other labors, it is rejected as the proper way of relating to those practices' objects.
It is mistaken to betoken ossified standards, as if a mastery in some discipline or practice entailed mastery over how others engage in the same activity.

Examples:
- the SLSA talk about basket weaving
- framing of the body as an object to be mastered (see intro to *Somatechnics*)
