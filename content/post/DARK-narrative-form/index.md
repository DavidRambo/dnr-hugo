*DARK* is not about a 33-year time loop.
It is a machine for arranging motifs of verdant yet gnarled and bare forests, for layering mysteries rooted in the transposition of events out of their time, and for depicting characters who come to realize that they are but needles that thread a plot.

Netflix's three-season German sci-fi drama stages a meditation on the medium of narrative, particularly cinematic narrative.
Its characters confront the arbitrary necessity of a narrative having been recorded.
They grapple with their existence first and foremost as characters constituting part of a temporal objectâ€”their presentation is diachronic-linear, yet their recording it synchronic-simultaneous.

When a character of one time zone meets themself of another time, it is as if a character on page 5 of a novel has been pressed against page 600 on which they co-exist as their 33-year-older self.
