### Locus of Control
Taking from research on the causes of procrastination, a person has a locus of control that may lean more toward external factors (low sense of control) or toward internal factors (higher sense of control or self-efficacy).

My first thought was that as I learn more about how the environment controls my life (experience, circumstances, livelihood, etc), the lower my sense of self-efficacy (or perhaps more constrained and therefore more focused?). 

Conversely, I could imagine that a person ignorant of the extent to which the world impacts their life would half a high sense of control because they would assume that they have a high degree of autonomy (but it would be misguided, and actions could be thwarted my misunderstood contextual forces).

There’s a quote of Bertrand Russel’s that derives a moral observation from this reflection: 

{{< blockquote >}}“The trouble with the world is that the stupid are cocksure and the intelligent are full of doubt.”
{{< /blockquote >}}

I'm not so sure about the stupidity-intelligence dichotomy. In my experience, increased *knowledge* has made me more hesitant. But that translation from knowledge to uncertainty needs a catalyst that shortcircuits what ought to result---increased autonomy due to a comprehension of worldly causality---with, instead, self-imposed hesitancy.

### Spinoza’s Approach
Spinoza helps to clarify what’s going on here. He would focus on the person who does not procrastinate because they lack knowledge of what controls them. Such misunderstood or under-informed action would be of limited efficacy. 

By contrast, the person who understands how the world impacts them can deploy that knowledge in a way that increases their own self-efficacy. They know when to distrust bodily sensations and to overrule those appetites.
