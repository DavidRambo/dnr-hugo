David Rambo is currently a postdoctoral associate at Duke University with the Program in Literature, where he earned a PhD in 2018. His research and teaching span contemporary fiction and media, the technological nature of human experience, process philosophy, and phenomenology. Rambo's essays have been published in <i>Process Studies</i>, <i>Angelaki</i>, <i>hyperrhiz</i>, and <i>Post-Cinema: Theorizing 21st-Century Film</i> (REFRAME 2016). His current book project, <i>Inventing Media</i>, argues that technology ought to be understood primarily as inventing new worlds and secondarily as technical objects and prostheses.

<p>David also enjoys tinkering and making things, which has entered into his work at the humanities lab <a href="https://s-1lab.org" alt="S-1: Speculative Sensation" target="_blank">S-1: Speculative Sensation</a> as well as in his research on media aesthetics and technoculture.
