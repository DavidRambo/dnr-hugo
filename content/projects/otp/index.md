title: "One-Time Pad over Sockets (C)"

This learning project is written in C and uses sockets to relay a ciphertext and plaintext between a server and multiple clients.
In addition to the requirements, I implemented a counting semaphore that limits the server programs to forking a maximum of five children.

The [repo](https://github.com/DavidRambo/otp374) is currently set to private, since this was an assignment.
