Over the years, I have designed posters for department events at Duke. I've made most with Canva (free, not premium). The main constraint is to fit in all the information: event info for the lecture, the seminar, co-sponsors, QR code, and so on. Packing it all in while maintaining a pleasing amount of the backdrop image is a fun puzzle.

### 2017: N. Katherine Hayles

Before the official inauguration of the Srinivas Aravamudan Annual Lecture, the Program in Literature gathered some of Kate's former students as well as notable scholars that have worked alongside her to celebrate her retirement from Duke. This flyer was made in (gasp!) Microsoft Word.
